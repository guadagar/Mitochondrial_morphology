## ODES and Figures

The scripts `av_react_2x2.py` have the code for the ODE system in each configuration. As it is provided, it is also necessary to have the average traces of the MCell simulations to generate the figures in the paper. This traces can be generated from scratch running MCEll simulations and after the script `generates_av.py`, but I also provide this in the publication's [page](https://r3lab.uni.lu/frozen/mitochondrial-morphology-provides-a-mechanism-for-energy-buffering-at-synapses), in the folder data.
